## 📊 GitHub Statistics
<p>
  <!-- Prefer cached local images (updated by the workflow below). If not present the links allow manual checks. -->
  [![GitHub Stats](assets/github-stats.png)](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=waseemnabi08&show_icons=true&theme=tokyonight&count_private=true&include_all_commits=true)
  [![Top Languages](assets/top-langs.png)](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=waseemnabi08&layout=compact&theme=tokyonight&langs_count=6)

Notes & troubleshooting:
- **Check live image URL:** open these links in your browser to confirm the service is reachable:
  - https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=waseemnabi08&show_icons=true&theme=tokyonight&count_private=true&include_all_commits=true
  - https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=waseemnabi08&layout=compact&theme=tokyonight&langs_count=6
- **Local preview vs GitHub:** VS Code's Markdown preview and some browsers/extensions block remote images; confirm by viewing the README on GitHub.com directly.
- **Adblock/CSP issues:** disable adblockers or privacy extensions, or try a different browser.
- **Private contributions:** to include private data set up a token (see below). The stats page supports `&count_private=true&include_all_commits=true` but the service may require a GitHub token for private repo data.
- **Fallback:** if the external service is blocked in your environment, enable the included GitHub Action to cache images into `assets/` (the action runs daily or manually), so the README displays the cached images.

How to enable the automatic caching (recommended):
1. Create a file at `.github/workflows/update-stats.yml` (already added to this repo) which fetches the generated images and commits them to `assets/` using the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
2. Optionally, create a repository secret named `GH_TOKEN` with a personal access token if you need private counts or broader permissions.

If you want I can enable a more advanced action that stores images in a release or uses a custom token — tell me whether you need private-commit stats and I'll add instructions.
