  <img align="left" alt="Waseem's GitHub Stats" src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=waseemnabi08&show_icons=true&theme=tokyonight&count_private=true&include_all_commits=true" />

Notes & troubleshooting:
- Make sure the `username` in the URL is correct (here: `waseemnabi08`).
- If images don't show: try disabling adblockers/CSP or view the raw README on GitHub (some browsers block external images).
- To include private contributions or better accuracy, add `&count_private=true&include_all_commits=true` as shown; for private data you may need to provide a `GH_TOKEN` or use the recommended setup in the github-readme-stats docs.
- If the card still fails, try a simplified URL to check connectivity:
  - `https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=waseemnabi08&theme=tokyonight`
- Alternate: use Shields (https://shields.io/) or other profile-card services as a fallback if vercel.app is blocked.
