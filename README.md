## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate Computer Engineering student with a deep interest in hardware-software co-design, AI, and deep learning. My journey revolves around bridging the gap between cutting-edge AI algorithms and efficient hardware, especially using FPGAs and Verilog.

Currently, I'm working on an exciting project:
- **FPGA-Based, User-Configured, Accelerator for Real-Time YOLO Object Detection**
  - Designing a hardware accelerator for real-time object detection using YOLO, built on FPGA technology.
  - Exploring how custom hardware can supercharge modern AI models for real-world applications.
  - Project is in its early stages—follow my progress for hardware-accelerated AI!
